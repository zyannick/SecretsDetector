A high-performance secret scanner designed to find leaked credentials and sensitive data in your files. SecretsDetector combines rule-based pattern matching (regex), statistical analysis (Shannon entropy), and machine learning to achieve high accuracy and reduce false positives.

This tool is built with performance in mind, leveraging C++ with SIMD instructions for computationally intensive tasks, making it suitable for integration into CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows.
